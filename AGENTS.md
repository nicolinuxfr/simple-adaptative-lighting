# Codex Instructions

- For any requested blueprint change, always apply the change in `template.yaml`.
- Always update all translation files in parallel when a blueprint text/key is changed.
- Change the version number inside the `VERSION` file only when asked to. Do not change it if I did not ask first.
- Respect a CalVer scheme like this for number version : `YYYY.MM.DD.x`. Earch day, the first version should remove the `.x`. Only add and increment the number on subsequent updates.
