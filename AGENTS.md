# Codex Instructions

- If `template.yaml` is modified, update `VERSION` in the same change.
- Do not modify `VERSION` when `template.yaml` was not modified.
- For any requested blueprint change, always apply the change in `template.yaml`.
- Always update all translation files in parallel when a blueprint text/key is changed.
